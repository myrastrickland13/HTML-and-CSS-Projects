				<p> Mist is a web novel English Translation of a Chinese novel. If you are into time travel with a mix of sci-fi, mystery, and thriller, this book is perfect for you.
				It kept me so enthralled, I finished the 103 chapters, plus 3 extras, in two days. It focuses on the character Ji Yushi, a person with hyperthymesia. 
				<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60102086-mist">Those with this condition can remember every detail of their lives from something as significant as the worldâ€™s turning point to something as small and as insignificant as a minor fleeting thought. 
				They cannot forget and their thirst for knowledge allows them to be considered a genius in some senses.</blockquote> Along with the other main character Song Qinglan and their squad, they will traverse different worlds in different times.
				This includes zombies, another multiverse, and more crazy things like a deadly rubik's cube building! But why are they being thrown into these different worlds? Read it and find out!</p>
